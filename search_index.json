Using data in this kind of structure can be very difficult for JavaScript applications, especially those using the single tree state management system such as Vuex or Redux.To nicely handle such \"deeply nested objects\", one approach is to split those nested data into each module and decouple them from each other.Simply put, it kind of likes treating a portion of your store as if it were a database, and keep that data in a normalized form.This is an excellent article that describes the hardness of the nested data structure. It also explains how to design normalized state.What Is It Like To Use Vuex ORMHere we show how it would look like to be using Vuex ORM on your application.Let's say you fetch posts data from a server and the response is something like below.const post = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    body: \"......\",\n    author: { id: 1, username: \"user1\", name: \"User 1\" },\n    comments: [\n      {\n        id : 1,\n        author : { id: 2, username: \"user2\", name : \"User 2\" },\n        comment : \".....\"\n      },\n      {\n        id: 2,\n        author: { id: 2, username: \"user2\", name: \"User 2\" },\n        comment: \".....\"\n      }\n    ]    \n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    author: { id: 2, username: \"user2\", name: \"User 2\" },\n    body: \"......\",\n    comments: [\n      {\n        id: 3,\n        author: { id: 3, username: \"user3\", name: \"User 3\" },\n        comment: \".....\"\n      },\n      {\n        id: 4,\n        author: { id: 1, username: \"user1\", name: \"User 1\" },\n        comment: \".....\"\n      },\n      {\n        id: 5,\n        author: { id: 3, username: \"user3\", name: \"User 3\" },\n        comment: \".....\"\n      }\n    ]    \n  }\n  // and so on...\n]\nSee there are lots of author fields and some of them are the exact same authors. If you save this data to the store as is, it's going to be very hard to update those authors or comments.When you store above posts data using Vuex ORM, the look of the Vuex Store State is going to be as below.// Save data using Vuex Action.\nstore.dispatch('entities/posts/create', { data: posts })\n\n// Then inside Vuex State becomes like this.\n{\n  entities: {\n    comments: {\n      data: {\n        \"1\": {\n          id: 1,\n          author: \"2\",\n          comment: \".....\"\n        },\n        \"2\": {\n          id: 2,\n          author: \"2\",\n          comment: \".....\"\n        },\n        \"3\": {\n          id: 3,\n          author: \"3\",\n          comment: \".....\"\n        },\n        \"4\": {\n          id: 4,\n          author: \"1\",\n          comment: \".....\"\n        },\n        \"5\": {\n          id: 5,\n          author: \"3\",\n          comment: \".....\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n\n    posts: {\n      data: {\n        \"1\": {\n          id: 1,\n          body: \"......\",\n          author: \"1\",\n          comments: [\"1\", \"2\"]  \n        },\n        \"2\": {\n          id: 2,\n          author: [\"2\"],\n          body: \"......\",\n          comments: [\"3\", \"4\", \"5\"]\n        }\n      }\n    },\n\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        \"1\": {\n          id: 1,\n          username: \"user1\",\n          name: \"User 1\" \n        },\n        \"2\": {\n          id: 2,\n          username: \"user2\",\n          name: \"User 2\" \n        },\n        \"3\": {\n          id: 3,\n          username: \"user3\",\n          name: \"User 3\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nSee how each data is decoupled and deduplicated. Then you can fetch these data using Vuex Getters. These getters are also built in by Vuex ORM.// Fetch only posts.\nconst posts = store.getters['entities/posts/all']()\n\n/*\n  [\n    { id: 1, body: \"......\" },\n    { id: 2, body: \"......\" }\n  ]\n*/\n\n// Fetch posts with relation.\nconst posts = store.getters['entities/posts/query']().with('author').get()\n\n/*\n  [\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      body: \"......\",\n      author: {\n        id: 1,\n        username: \"user1\",\n        name: \"User 1\" \n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      body: \"......\",\n      author: {\n        id: 2,\n        username: \"user2\",\n        name: \"User 2\" \n      }\n    }\n  ]\n*/\n\n// Fetch data matching specific condition.\nconst posts = store.getters['entities/posts/query']()\n  .with('author')\n  .where('id', 1) // Id of post.\n  .get()\n\n/*\n  [\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      body: \"......\",\n      author: {\n        id: 1,\n        username: \"user1\",\n        name: \"User 1\" \n      }\n    }\n  ]\n*/\nNot only fetching saved data, but Vuex ORM also lets you create Model Class for each data structure. So when you retrieve data from the store by getters, those become a class instance.{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        \"1\": {\n          id: 1,\n          first_name: 'John',\n          last_name: 'Doe'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Define Model as class.\nimport { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  fullName () {\n    return this.first_name + ' ' + this.last_name\n  }\n}\n\n// Fetch user from the store.\nconst user = store.getters['entities/users/find'](1)\n\n// The `user` is an instance of User class!\nuser.first_name // John\nuser.last_name  // Doe\nuser.fullName() // John Doe\nNow, are you ready to start using Vuex ORM? Let's get started."},"prologue/installation.html":{"url":"prologue/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Prologue: InstallationYou can install Vuex ORM via NPM, Yarn, or download directly.

It assumes you have a basic understanding of Vuex. If you are not familiar with Vuex, please visit Vuex Documentation to learn about Vuex.NOTE: We will be using ES2015 syntax for code examples for the rest of the docs. Also, we use \"Class Property\" to define some property in the class. This syntax requires compilers such as babel-preset-stage-2 which is already included in Vue CLI template.Core ArchitectureTo setup Vuex ORM, you must first create following components.Models\n\nModules\n\nDatabase\n\nYou usually first create models and modules, then register them to the database. Finally, install the database to the Vuex as a plugin.Create ModelsModels represent schema of the data which is going to be stored at Vuex Store. The schema would often be same as API response from the server, but it could be whatever you like.Models can also have relationships with other models like any other ORM library. For example, a post belongs to a user, or post has many comments.Let's declare models by extending Vuex ORM Model.// User Model\nimport { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\n\nexport default class User extends Model {\n  // This is the name used as module name of the Vuex Store.\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  // List of all fields (schema) of the post model. `this.attr` is used\n  // for the generic field type. The argument is the default value.\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(''),\n      email: this.attr(''),\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n// Post Model\nimport { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\nimport User from './User'\n\nexport default class Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    // `this.belongsTo` is for belongs to relationship. The first argument\n    // is the Model class, and second is the foreign key.\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null),\n      title: this.attr(''),\n      body: this.attr(''),\n      published: this.attr(false),\n      author: this.belongsTo(User, 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe above example shows that there are User Model and Post Model. Post Model has belongsTo relationship to User at author key.If you don't want use \"Class Property\" syntax such as static entity, you can define them differently too.class User extends Model {\n  // ...\n}\n\nUser.entity = 'users'\n\n// Or...\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static get entity () {\n    return 'users'\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\nYou can learn more about Models at Models.Create ModulesModules are just simple Vuex Module that correspond to the Models. Vuex ORM uses this module to interact with Vuex Store.Vuex ORM is going to add any necessary states, getters, actions, and mutations, so you do not have to add anything to the modules, but if you want you can. When you do, just treat them as standard Vuex Module.// The users module. If you do not need any specific features, you can\n// leave it an empty object.\nexport default {}\n\n// The posts module. You can add any additional things you want.\nexport default {\n  state: {\n    fetched: false\n  },\n\n  actions: {\n    fetch ({ commit }) {\n      commit('fetch')\n    }\n  },\n\n  mutations: {\n    fetch (state) {\n      state.fetched = true\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou may learn more about modules at Modules And Store.Register Models and Modules to the Vuex StoreNow it is time for you to register Models and Modules to the Vuex. To do so, register Models and Modules you have created to the Database instance, and then register the Database to Vuex Store as Vuex plugin.Use install when registering VuexORM as a plugin.import Vue from 'vue'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport VuexORM from '@vuex-orm/core'\nimport User from './User'\nimport Post from './Post'\nimport users from './users'\nimport posts from './posts'\n\nVue.use(Vuex)\n\n// Create new instance of Database.\nconst database = new VuexORM.Database()\n\n// Register Model and Module. The First argument is the Model, and\n// second is the Module.\ndatabase.register(User, users)\ndatabase.register(Post, posts)\n\n// Create Vuex Store and register database through Vuex ORM.\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\n  plugins: [VuexORM.install(database)]\n})\n\nexport default store\nNow you are ready to go. Vuex ORM is going to create entities module in Vuex Store State, and register any other modules under the entities namespace.The state tree inside Vuex Store is going be as follows.store.state.entities\n\n/*\n  {\n    entities: {\n      posts: {\n        data: {}\n      },\n      users: {\n        data: {}\n      }\n    }\n  }\n*/\nLearn more about plugin registration at Database And Registration.Creating Data To Vuex StoreYou can use create action to create a new record in Vuex Store. Let's say we want to save a single post data to the store.// Assuming this data structure is the response from the API backend.\nconst posts = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    title: 'Hello, world!',\n    body: 'Some awesome body...',\n    author: {\n      id: 1,\n      name: 'John Doe',\n      email: 'john@example.com'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nstore.dispatch('entities/posts/create', { data: posts })\nWith above action, Vuex ORM creates the following schema at Vuex Store.// Inside `store.state.entities`.\n{\n  posts: {\n    data: {\n      '1': {\n        id: 1,\n        user_id: 1,\n        title: 'Hello, world!',\n        body: 'Some awesome body...',\n        author: 1\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  users: {\n    data: {\n      '1': {\n        id: 1,\n        name: 'John Doe',\n        email: 'john@example.com'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nSee how posts and users decoupled from each other. This is what it means for \"normalizing\" the data.Retrieving Data From Vuex StoreTo retrieve data, you may just access the store state directly as usual.store.state.entities.posts.data[1].title // \nHowever, Vuex ORM provides a way to query, and fetch data in an organized way through Vuex Getters.// Fetch all post records. The result will be wrapped with Post model!\nstore.getters['entities/posts/all']()\n\n/*\n  [\n    Post { id: 1, user_id: 1, title: 'Hello, world!', body: 'Some awesome body...', author: 1 },\n    Post { id: 2, user_id: 2, title: 'Hello, another world!', body: 'Some another awesome body...', author: 2 },\n    ...\n  ]\n*/\n\n// Fetch single record with relation.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().with('author').first()\n\n/*\n  Post {\n    id: 1,\n    user_id: 1,\n    title: 'Hello, world!',\n    body: 'Some awesome body...',\n    author: User {\n      id: 1,\n      name: 'John Doe',\n      email: 'john@example.com'\n    }\n  }\n*/\nLearn more about retrieving data from the Store at Store: Retrieving Data"},"core-components.html":{"url":"core-components.html","title":"Core Components","keywords":"","body":"Core ComponentsVuex ORM is mainly built with three components – Model, Module, and Database.

Notice there is entities state. This state is created by Vuex ORM automatically, and all of the Model data will be stored in this namespace. Please take a look at Modules And Store to learn more about how Vuex ORM interact with Vuex Store.Fieldsstatic fields() should return the schema of the data.import { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\nFor this example, User model has id and name fields. The key represents the name of the field (as database's column) and value represents its type of the field. The User model uses this.attr() for both id and name. This is the most generic type of the field and the argument is the default value that will be used when instantiating the model class.These fields are going to be attached as instance property when instantiating the model.const user = new User({ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' })\n\nuser.id // \nOther Optional FieldsPrimary KeyVuex ORM will assume that each data has a primary key named id. You may define a static primaryKey property to override this convention.import { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static primaryKey = 'my_id'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      my_id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou can also define a composite primary key by passing array of keys.import { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\n\nclass Vote extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static primaryKey = ['user_id', 'vote_id']\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      user_id: this.attr(''),\n      vote_id: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\nAttributesThere are several model attributes you can use to define model fields.Generic TypeUse this.attr() method to define the most generic field. The argument is the default value of the field which will be used when creating a new data if the field is not present.class User extends Model {\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr('John Doe')\n    }\n  }\n}\nAuto Increment Typethis.increment() method will generate field type which will be auto incremented. Autoincrement field must be a number and should not have arguments. The value of this field gets incremented when you create a new record.class User extends Model {\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.increment(),\n      name: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\nRelationshipsYou can a relationship between deferent models.

If the inserting data has the same primary key as existing data, that data is going to be replaced by the new one.// Initial State.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        '2': { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// `insert` is going to leave existing data as is.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/insert', {\n  data: {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'John'\n  }\n})\n\n// State after `insert`.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        '1': { id: 1, name: 'John' },\n        '2': { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nInsert Many DataYou can pass an array of objects to insert multiple data.

Please see Inserting Relationships for more detail.UpdatesTo update existing data, you can do so with update action. update action takes where condition and data as payload.store.dispatch('entities/users/update', {\n  where: 2,\n  data: { age: 24 }\n})\nwhere condition can be a Number or a String representing the value of the primary key of the model or can be a Function to determine the target data. Function takes the record as the argument and must return Boolean.data is the data you want to update.Let's see some example here to understand how it works.// Initial State.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      '1': { id: 1, name: 'John', age: 20 },\n      '2': { id: 2, name: 'Jane', age: 30 }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Update data.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/update', {\n  where: 2,\n  data: { age: 24 }\n})\n\n// State after `update`\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      '1': { id: 1, name: 'John', age: 20 },\n      '2': { id: 2, name: 'Jane', age: 24 }\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou can pass a function to the where to get more control. Remember to return boolean in this case.store.dispatch('entities/users/update', {\n  where: (record) => {\n    return record.id === 2\n  },\n\n  data: { age: 24 }\n})\nAlternatively, you may pass whole data object as a payload. In this case, the primary key must exist in the data object.store.dispatch('entities/users/update', {\n  id: 2, // \nUpdating Multiple DataWhen specifying where condition by a function, it's possible to update multiple records at once.// Initial State.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      '1': { id: 1, role: 'user', active: true },\n      '2': { id: 2, role: 'user', active: true },\n      '3': { id: 3, role: 'admin', active: true }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Update data.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/update', {\n  where (record) {\n    return record.role === 'user'\n  },\n\n  data: { active: false }\n})\n\n// State after `update`.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      '1': { id: 1, role: 'user', active: false },\n      '2': { id: 2, role: 'user', active: false },\n      '3': { id: 3, role: 'admin', active: true }\n    }\n  }\n}\nGet Updated DataAs same as insert or create, the update action also returns updated data as a Promise.store.dispatch('entities/users/update', { id: 1, age: 24 })\n  .then((user) => {\n    console.log(user)\n  })\n\n// User { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 24 }\nWhen updating many records by specifying closure to the where property, the returned data will always be an array containing all updated data.store.dispatch('entities/users/update', {\n  where: record => record.age === 30,\n  data { age: 24 }\n).then((users) => {\n  console.log(users)\n})\n\n/*\n  [\n    User { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 24 },\n    User { id: 2, name: 'Jane Doe', age: 24 }\n  ]\n*/\nInsert or UpdateSometimes you might want to insert a set of records which includes already existing and new records. When using the insert action you would replace the dataset of an already existing record. This can cause unexpected side effects.For example if an API supports dynamic embedding of relationships and doesn't always return all relationships, the relationships would be emptied when missing on insert.For those cases you can use the insertOrUpdate action:// Initial State.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        '1': { id: 1, name: 'John', roles: [3] }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// `insertOrUpdate` is going to add new records and update existing\n// records (see `update`). Also accepts a single item as data.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/insertOrUpdate', {\n  data: [\n    { id: 1, name: 'Peter' }, \n    { id: 2, name: 'Hank' }\n  ]\n})\n\n// State after `insertOrUpdate`. Roles for Peter won't be set to empty array\n// The new record is inserted with an empty relationship.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        '1': { id: 1, name: 'Peter', roles: [3] }, \n        '2': { id: 2, name: 'Hank', roles: [] }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nDispatching Actions from Root ModuleYou can dispatch action from root module as well. With this syntax, you must specify the entity manually by passing entity field.store.dispatch('entities/create', { entity: 'users', data: { ... } })\n\n// Above is equivalent to this.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/create', { data: { ... } })\nNote that since root module needs entity, you can't dispatch update action through root by passing condition directly.// This would not work.\nstore.dispatch('entities/update', { id: 2, age: 24 })\n\n// you must have entity field.\nstore.dispatch('entities/update', {\n  entity: 'users',\n  where: 2,\n  data: { age: 24 }\n})\n"},"store/retrieving-data.html":{"url":"store/retrieving-data.html","title":"Retrieving Data","keywords":"","body":"Store: Retrieving DataYou can use getters to retrieve data from the Vuex Store. Not only it fetches the data, but Vuex ORM will convert those fetched data into a model class instance.const user = store.getters['entities/users/find'](1)\n\n// User { id: 1, name: 'name' }\nNOTE: To fetch data with its relationship, you must call with method during the query. Please see Retrieving Relationships for more detail.Get All Dataall getter is going to fetch all data from the store.const users = store.getters['entities/users/all']()\n\n/*\n  [\n    User { id: 1, name: 'John' },\n    User: { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }\n  ]\n*/\nGet Single Datafind getter is going to fetch single data from the store.// Retrieve a record by its primary key.\nconst users = store.getters['entities/users/find'](1)\n\n// User { id: 1, name: 'John' }\nQuery BuilderThe query getter will return the query builder that provides fluent API to search and fetch data from the store. You can use the query builder to construct the more complex query conditions.You can obtain query builder by calling query getter.const query = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\nOr you may omit query and directly call module. This is just a shorthand for the query getter.const query = store.getters['entities/users']()\nGet All DataUse get or all method to fetch all data for the entity. The result is going to be an array containing a list of model instances.const users = store.getters['entities/users/query']().get()\n\n// or\n\nconst users = store.getters['entities/users/query']().all()\n\n// [User { id: 1, name: 'John' }, User: { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }]\nGet A Single DataUse first or find method to fetch a single data for the entity. It will return the very first item in the state.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().first()\n\n// or\n\nconst user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().find()\n\n// User { id: 1, name: 'John' }\nGet The Last Matching DataAs oppose to first method, the last method returns the last matching data.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().last()\nWhere ClausesSimple Where ClausesYou may use the where method on a query chain to add where conditions. For example, here is a query that fetches all users that have \"age\" value of \"20\".const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().where('age', 20).get()\n\n// [User { id: 1, age: 20 }, User { id: 2, age: 20 }]\nYou may pass a closure to the 2nd argument when you need more powerful constraint. The argument is the value of the field.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().where('age', value => value > 20).get()\n\n// [User { id: 1, age: 25 }, User { id: 2, age: 30 }]\nOr, you may pass a closure to the 1st argument to get full control of the condition. The argument is the data itself.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().where(record => record.age > 20).get()\n\n// [User { id: 1, age: 25 }, User { id: 2, age: 30 }]\nWhen passing a closure to the 1st argument, it will also receive query builder as the 2nd argument. By using the query builder, you may nest the where clause. This is useful when you want \"group\" the where clauses.// Retrieve all users with role of user, and age of 20 or id of 1.\nconst user = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\n  .where('role', 'user')\n  .where((_record, query) => {\n    query.where('age', 20).orWhere('id', 1)\n  })\n  .get()\nFinally, the model instance is passed as a 3rd argument. It's useful when you want to use a model method or mutated property for the condition.class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'entity'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(''),\n      role: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n\n  isAdmin () {\n    return this.role === 'admin'\n  }\n}\n\nconst user = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\n  .where((_record, _query, model) => {\n    return model.isAdmin()\n  })\n  .get()\nOr StatementYou may chain where constraints together as well as add or condition to the query. The orWhere method accepts the same arguments as the where method.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\n  .where('role', 'admin')\n  .orWhere('name', 'John')\n  .get()\n\n// [User { id: 1, name: 'John', role: 'user' }, User { id: 2, name: 'Jane', role: 'admin' }]\nOrder ByThe orderBy method allows you to sort the result of the query by a given field. The first argument to the orderBy method should be the column you wish to sort by, while the second argument controls the direction of the sort and may be either asc or desc. If there is no 2nd argument, the direction is going to be asc.// Order users by name.\nconst user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().orderBy('name').get()\n\n// [User { id: 2, name: 'Andy' }, { id: 1, name: 'John' }]\n\n// You may also chain orderBy.\nconst user = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\n    .orderBy('name')\n    .orderBy('age', 'desc')\n    .get()\n\n// [User { id: 4, name: 'Andy', age: 32 }, { id: 2, name: 'Andy', age: 27 }]\nOffset & LimitUse offset method to set the offset for the data.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().offset(2).get()\n\n// [User { id: 3, age: 35 }, User { id: 4, age: 40 }]\nUse limit method to set the maximum number of records to retrieve.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']().limit(2).get()\n\n// [User { id: 1, age: 25 }, User { id: 2, age: 30 }]\nBoth offset and limit can be chained together to paginate through data.const user = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\n  .offset(1)\n  .limit(2)\n  .get()\n\n// [User { id: 2, age: 30 }, User { id: 3, age: 35 }]\nAggregatesThe query builder also provides aggregate methods. Available methods are count, max and min.const users = store.getters['entities/users/query']().count()\n\nconst mostLiked = store.getters['entities/posts/query']().max('like')\n\nconst cheapest = store.getters['entities/orders/query']().min('price')\nOf course, you may combine these methos with other clauses.const users = store.getters['entities/users/query']()\n  .where('role', 'user')\n  .count()\n"},"store/deleting-data.html":{"url":"store/deleting-data.html","title":"Deleting Data","keywords":"","body":"Store: Deleting DataYou can delete data by delete action.

The below example shows that the Post has the relationship with Comment of hasMany.class Comment extends Model {\n  static entity = 'comments'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      post_id: this.attr(null),\n      body: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      title: this.attr(''),\n      body: this.attr(''),\n      comments: this.hasMany(Comment, 'post_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nBy defining the relationship, Vuex ORM is going to use those relationships to construct data when storing, modifying and fetching data from Vuex Store.One To OneA one-to-one relationship is defined by this.hasOne method. For example, User might have one profile information.class Profile extends Model {\n  static entity = 'profiles'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null),\n      age: this.attr(''),\n      sex: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(''),\n      profile: this.hasOne(Profile, 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe first argument of this.hasOne is the related model, which is, in this case, are Profile model. The second argument is the \"foreign key\" which holds the primary key of the User model. For this example, the foreign key is the user_id at Profile model.Additionally, Vuex ORM assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the id (or the custom static primaryKey) field of the parent. In other words, Vuex ORM will look for the value of the user's id column in the user_id column of the Profile record. If you would like the relationship to use a value other than id, you may pass the third argument to the hasOne method specifying your custom key:class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      local_id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(''),\n      profile: this.hasOne(Profile, 'user_id', 'local_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nOne To One InverseTo define an inverse relationship of one-to-one, you can do so with this.belongsTo() attribute.class Profile extends Model {\n  static entity = 'profiles'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null),\n      age: this.attr(''),\n      sex: this.attr(''),\n      user: this.belongsTo(User, 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\nNow the above Profile model has belongs to relationship to the User model. The arguments are pretty much same with this.hasOne. The first argument is the related model, and second is the \"foreign key\", but of course this time the foreign key exists in the Profile model.If your parent model – User in this case – does not use id as its primary key, or you wish to join the child model to a different field, you may pass the third argument to the belongsTo method specifying your parent table's custom key:class Profile extends Model {\n  static entity = 'profiles'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null),\n      age: this.attr(''),\n      sex: this.attr(''),\n      user: this.belongsTo(User, 'user_id', 'other_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nOne To ManyA one-to-many relationship can be defined by this.hasMany.class Comment extends Model {\n  static entity = 'comments'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      post_id: this.attr(null),\n      body: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      title: this.attr(''),\n      body: this.attr(''),\n      comments: this.hasMany(Comment, 'post_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nFor this example, Post has many Comments. The arguments for the this.hasMany is again pretty much same as the others. The first argument is the model, and second is the 'foreign key' of the related model.Then of course, the 3rd argument can override which id to look up on parent model, which is Post in this case.class Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      local_id: this.attr(null),\n      title: this.attr(''),\n      body: this.attr(''),\n      comments: this.hasMany(Comment, 'post_id', 'local_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\nHas Many ByIn some case, the model itself has all the keys of the related model. Like below example.{\n  nodes: {\n    '1': { id: 1 },\n    '2': { id: 1 }\n  },\n  clusters: {\n    '1': {\n      id: 1,\n      nodes: [1, 2]\n    }\n  }\n}\nAs you can see, clusters want to have hasMany relationship with nodes, but nodes do not have cluster_id. You cannot use this.hasMany in this case because there is no foreign key to look for. In such case, you may use this.hasManyBy relationship.class Node extends Model {\n  static entities = 'nodes'\n\n  static field () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Cluster extends Model {\n  static entities = 'clusters'\n\n  static field () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      nodes: this.hasManyBy(Node, 'nodes')\n    }\n  }\n}\nNow the cluster model is going to look for nodes using ids at clusters own nodes attributes. As always, you can pass the third argument to specify which id to look for.class Cluster extends Model {\n  static entities = 'clusters'\n\n  static field () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      nodes: this.hasManyBy(Node, 'nodes', 'other_key')\n    }\n  }\n}\nMany To ManyMany-to-many relations are slightly more complicated than other relationships. An example of such a relationship is a user with many roles, where the roles are also shared by other users. For example, many users may have the role of \"Admin\". To define this relationship, three models are needed: User, Role, and RoleUser. \nThe RoleUser contains the fields to hold id of User and Role model. We'll define user_id and role_id fields here.The name of RoleUser model coud be anything but for this example, we'll keep it this way to make it easy to understand.Many-to-many relationships are defined by defining attribute of the belongsToMany.class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      roles: this.belongsToMany(Role, RoleUser, 'user_id', 'role_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Role extends Model {\n  static entity = 'roles'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass RoleUser extends Model {\n  static entity = 'roleUser'\n\n  static primaryKey = ['role_id', 'user_id']\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      role_id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\nThe argument order of the belongsToMany attribute is;The Related model which is in this case Role.\n\nIntermidiate pivot model which is RoleUser.\n\nField of the pivot model that holds id value of the parent – User – model.\n\nField of the pivot model that holds id value of the related – Role – model.\n\nYou may also define custom local key at 4th and 5th argument.class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      roles: this.belongsToMany(\n        Role,\n        RoleUser,\n        'user_id',\n        'role_id',\n        'user_local_id',\n        'role_local_id'\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\nDefining The Inverse Of The RelationshipTo define the inverse of a many-to-many relationship, you place another belongsToMany attribute on your related model. To continue our user roles example, let's define the users method on the Role model:class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Role extends Model {\n  static entity = 'roles'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      users: this.belongsToMany(User, RoleUser, 'role_id', 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass RoleUser extends Model {\n  static entity = 'roleUser'\n\n  static primaryKey = ['role_id', 'user_id']\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      role_id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\nAs you can see, the relationship is defined the same as its User counterpart, except referencing the User model and the order of 3rd and 4th argument is inversed.Has Many ThroughThe \"has-many-through\" relationship provides a convenient shortcut for accessing distant relations via an intermediate relation. For example, a Country might have many Post through an intermediate User. In this example, you could easily gather all posts for a given country. Let's look at the models required to define this relationship:class Country extends Model {\n  static entity = 'countries'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      posts: this.hasManyThrough(Post, User, 'country_id', 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      country_id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\nThough posts do not contain a country_id column, the hasManyThrough relation provides access to a country's posts. To perform this query, Vuex ORM inspects the country_id on the intermediate User model. After finding the matching user IDs, they are used to query the Post model.The first argument passed to the hasManyThrough method is the final model we wish to access, while the second argument is the intermediate model. The third argument is the name of the foreign key on the intermediate model. The fourth argument is the name of the foreign key on the final model.If you would like to customize the local key for the models, you could also pass the fifth argument which is the local key, while the sixth argument is the local key of the intermediate model.this.hasManyThrough(\n  Post, // Final model we wish to access.\n  User, // Intermediate model.\n  'country_id', // Foreign key on User model.\n  'user_id', // Foreign key on Post model.\n  'id', // Local key on Country model.\n  'id' // Local key on User model.\n)\nNOTE: When creating data that contains hasManyThrough relationship without intermediate relation, the intermediate record will not be generated. See here for more details.Polymorphic RelationsPolymorphic relations allow a model to belong to more than one other model on a single association. For example, imagine users of your application can \"comment\" both posts and videos. Using polymorphic relationships, you can use a single comments entity for both of these scenarios.To build these relationships, you need to declare three models.class Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      comments: this.morphMany(Comment, 'commentable_id', 'commentable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Video extends Model {\n  static entity = 'videos'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      comments: this.morphMany(Comment, 'commentable_id', 'commentable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Comment extends Model {\n  static entity = 'comments'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      body: this.attr(''),\n      commentable_id: this.attr(null),\n      commentable_type: this.attr(null),\n    }\n  }\n}\nTwo important fields to note are the commentable_id and commentable_type on the Comment model. The commentable_id field will contain the ID value of the Post or Video, while the commentable_type field will contain the entity name of the owning model. The commentable_type field is how the Vuex ORM determines which \"type\" of owning model to return when accessing the commentable relation.this.morphMany method defined at both Post and Video model is the definition of the relationship. Now you may fetch comment for the model as usual.store.getters['entities/posts/query'].with('comments').find(1)\n\n/*\n  Post {\n    id: 1,\n    comments: [\n      Comment { id: 1, body: 'comment 1' },\n      Comment { id: 2, body: 'comment 2' }\n    ]\n  }\n*/\nYou may also retrieve the owner of a polymorphic relation from the polymorphic model by defining morphTo attribute.class Comment extends Model {\n  static entity = 'comments'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      body: this.attr(''),\n      commentable_id: this.attr(null),\n      commentable_type: this.attr(null),\n      commentable: this.morphTo('commentable_id', 'commentable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nstore.getters['entities/comments/query'].with('commentable').get()\n\n/*\n  [\n    Comment {\n      id: 1,\n      body: 'comment 1',\n      commentable_id: 1,\n      commentable_type: 'posts',\n      commentable: Post {\n        id: 1\n      }\n    },\n    Comment {\n      id: 2,\n      body: 'comment 2',\n      commentable_id: 5,\n      commentable_type: 'videos'\n      commentable: Video {\n        id: 5\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n*/\nOne To One Polimorphic RelationYou can use morphOne method to define the one-to-one polymorphic relation.class Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      comments: this.morphOne(Comment, 'commentable_id', 'commentable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\nMany To Many Polymorphic RelationsIn addition to traditional polymorphic relations, you may also define \"many-to-many\" polymorphic relations. For example, a blog Post and Video model could share a polymorphic relation to a Tag model. Using a many-to-many polymorphic relation allows you to have a single list of unique tags that are shared across blog posts and videos.You can define many-to-many polymorphic relations by using this.morphToMany attribute.class Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      tags: this.morphToMany(Tag, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Video extends Model {\n  static entity = 'videos'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      tags: this.morphToMany(Tag, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Tag extends Model {\n  static entity = 'tags'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Taggable extends Model {\n  static entity = 'taggables'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      tag_id: this.attr(null),\n      taggable_id: this.attr(null),\n      taggable_type: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\nDefining The Inverse Of The RelationshipTo define the inverse relation to fetch related record – for this example it's for Tag model – you can use this.morphedByMany attribute.class Tag extends Model {\n  static entity = 'tags'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(''),\n      posts: this.morphedByMany(Post, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type'),\n      videos: this.morphedByMany(Video, Taggable, 'tag_id', 'taggable_id', 'taggable_type')\n    }\n  }\n}\n"},"relationships/inserting-relationships.html":{"url":"relationships/inserting-relationships.html","title":"Inserting Relationships","keywords":"","body":"Relationships: Inserting RelationshipsWhen inserting data into the store through Vuex ORM action such as create and insert, it will normalize any relationship if data contains them.Let's look at an example. Here we assume you have User and Post model. User relationship of hasMany with Posts.class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr(''),\n      posts: this.hasMany(User, 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null),\n      title: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n}\nAnd let's say you have following data that is user object but has related posts within. This is probably what you would get as a response from the API backend.{\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  posts: [\n    { id: 1, user_id: 1, title: '...' },\n    { id: 2, user_id: 1, title: '...' },\n    { id: 3, user_id: 1, title: '...' }\n  ]\n}\nIf you save this data to the store by create or insert action, it will be normalized and saved at under corresponding module.store.dispatch('entities/users/create', { data })\n\n// Inside store.\n{\n  entities: {\n    users: {\n      data: {\n        '1': { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }\n      }\n    },\n    posts: {\n      data: {\n        '1': { id: 1, user_id: 1, title: '...' },\n        '2': { id: 2, user_id: 1, title: '...' },\n        '3': { id: 3, user_id: 1, title: '...' }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nChoosing The Insert Method Of The Related RecordsWhen you insert data with related records included, all of the related records will be inserted using the base action that called. For example, if you call create actions, all of the related records get \"created\" into the store.store.dispatch('entities/users/create', { data })\nSometimes, you might want the option to choose how Vuex ORM inserts data into the store depending on the relationship. For example, you might want to \"create\" users but \"insert\" posts. You may do so by passing additional create or insert options to the action.// `create` users but `insert` posts.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/create', {\n  data: [{ ... }],\n  insert: ['posts']\n})\n\n// `insert` users but `create` posts and `comments`.\nstore.dispatch('entities/users/insert', {\n  data: [{ ... }],\n  create: ['posts', 'comments']\n})\nNote that the value passed to those create or insert options should be the name of the entity. Not the name of the field that defines the relationship in the User model.Creating Has Many Through RelationshipWhen creating data that contains hasManyThrough relationship without intermediate relation, the intermediate record will not be generated.Let's say you have following model definitions.class Country extends Model {\n  static entity = 'countries'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      users: this.hasMany(User, 'country_id'),\n      posts: this.hasManyThrough(Post, User, 'country_id', 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      country_id: this.attr(null),\n      posts: this.hasMany(Post, 'user_id')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass Post extends Model {\n  static entity = 'posts'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      user_id: this.attr(null)\n    }\n  }\n}\nAnd then you try to save following data.const data = {\n  id: 1,\n  posts: [\n    { id: 1 },\n    { id: 2 }\n  ]\n}\n\nstore.dispatch('entities/countries/create', { data })\nVuex ORM will normalize those data and save them to the store as below.{\n  countries: {\n    data: {\n      '1': { id: 1 }\n    }\n  },\n  users: {\n    data: {}\n  },\n  posts: {\n    data: {\n      '1': { id: 1, user_id: null },\n      '2': { id: 2, user_id: null }\n    }\n  }\n}\nSee there is no users record, and user_id at posts becomes empty. This happens because Vuex ORM wouldn't have any idea how would that posts relates to the intermediate model – User –. Hence if you create data like this, you wouldn't be able to retrieve them by getters anymore.So in such case, it is recommended to create data with the intermediate table.const data = {\n  id: 1,\n  users: [\n    {\n      id: 1,\n      posts: [\n        { id: 1 }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      posts: [\n        { id: 2 }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nstore.dispatch('entities/countries/create', { data })\n"},"relationships/retrieving-relationships.html":{"url":"relationships/retrieving-relationships.html","title":"Retrieving Relationships","keywords":"","body":"Relationships: Retrieving RelationshipsYou can use with method to load related model when querying data.

For example, imagine you want to retrieve all blog posts that have at least one comment. To do so, you may pass the name of the relationship to the has methods.// Retrieve all posts that have at least one comment.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().has('comments').get()\nYou may also specify count as well.// Retrieve all posts that have at least 2 comments.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().has('comments', 2).get()\nAlso, you may add an operator to customize your query even more. The supported operators are >, >=,  and .// Retrieve all posts that have more than 2 comments.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().has('comments', '>' 2).get()\n\n// Retrieve all posts that have less than or exactly 3 comments.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().has('comments', '\nAnd even more, you can pass closure for a complex query. If closure may return boolean, or it can just add constraints to the query.// Retrieve all posts that have user_id of 1.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().has('comments', (query) => {\n  query.where('user_id', 1)\n}).get()\n\n// Retrieve all posts that have more than 2 comments with user_id of 1.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().has('comments', (query) => {\n  return query.where('user_id', 1).count() > 2\n}).get()\nQuerying Relationship AbsenceTo retrieve records depending on absence of the relationship, use hasNot method. hasNot method will work same as has but in opposite result.// Retrieve all posts that doesn't have comments.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().hasNot('comments').get()\n\n// Retrieve all posts that doesn't have comment with user_id of 1.\nstore.getters['entities/posts/query']().hasNot('comments', (query) => {\n  query.where('user_id', 1)\n}).get()\n"},"advanced-usage.html":{"url":"advanced-usage.html","title":"Advanced Usage","keywords":"","body":"Advanced UsageHere are few more advanced technique you can use to enhance your data handling.Interact With Store From Model\n\nAccessors & Mutators\n\nSerialization\n\n"},"advanced/interact-with-store-from-model.html":{"url":"advanced/interact-with-store-from-model.html","title":"Interact With Store From Model","keywords":"","body":"Advanced: Interact With Store From ModelAlternative for calling store methods directly, you may access store instance from a model as well to dispatch actions or call getters.const user = User.dispatch('create', { data: ... })\n\n// The above code is exactly same as below.\n\nconst user = store.dispatch('entities/users/create', { data: ... })\nAccessing store from a model does nothing special compared to accessing the store directly.

For example, you might want to modify some value to display nicely on the browser, but you still want to keep actual data as is inside Vuex Store.Defining AccessorsTo define an accessor, just create a getter or a method in the model. In this example, we'll define full_name getter and prefix method to the User model.class User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      first_name: this.attr(''),\n      last_name: this.attr('')\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Get full name of the user.\n   */\n  get full_name () {\n    return `${this.first_name} ${this.last_name}`\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Add given prefix to the user's full name.\n   */\n  prefix (prefix) {\n    return `${prefix} ${this.full_name}`\n  }\n}\nAs you can see, these are just ordinally JavaScript class definition.

The difference between accessors and mutators is that mutators are going to modify the field itself. There are two ways to do this.Via AttributeYou can pass a closure to the 2nd argument of attr method. The closure takes the corresponding value as an argument, and you can modify the value however you want.import { Model } from '@vuex-orm/core'\n\nclass User extends Model {\n  static entity = 'users'\n\n  static fields () {\n    return {\n      id: this.attr(null),\n      name: this.attr('', value => value.toUpperCase())\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst user = new User({ name: 'john doe' })\n\nuser.name // \nVia Mutators MethodYou can also define mutators in one place by creating static mutators method.

However, when you would like to add global features when querying data, it might be useful to use lifecycle hook.
